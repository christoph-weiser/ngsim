    """ Generate names, filepaths etc. for regression test.

    Required inputs:
    ----------------
    filename (str):     .conf file holding simulation details.
    indentifier (str):  unique identifier for result file
    cwd (str):          current working directory

    Description
    ----------------
    This function prepares all the variables required to run
    a regression test. It works based on the predefined structure
    that is assumed when building up regession tests.
    This structure likes like this:

    root/
        |--tb_name.sch
        |--tests/
                |--tb_name.conf

    This should be called from a analysis script to get the

    This assumes a system, where the files are named with a
    timestamp, such that sorting them results in a orderly list.
